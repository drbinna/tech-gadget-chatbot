# 🤖 Tech Gadget Chatbot

A lightweight, rule-based chatbot designed for answering customer support queries about a fictional smart home device — the **SmartHome Hub Pro**.

This project was developed as part of a Generative AI lab using open-source tools and is fully deployable via [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/drbinna/tech-gadget-chatbot) using Gradio.

## 💡 What It Does

The chatbot handles simple queries using keyword-based logic — no LLMs or external APIs required.

### Supported Topics:

* **📦 Shipping:** “When will my order arrive?”
* **🔁 Returns:** “Can I get a refund?”
* **📋 Product Info:** “What does the SmartHome Hub Pro do?”
* **🛠 Troubleshooting:** “My device isn’t working.”

Ideal for testing chatbot UX without the overhead of model inference.
